// This file contains height and width variables that we can use throughout the
// project. Values should preferably be kept in `px` units, as a lot of designs
// still think in those values. `px` units should then be converted _in use_,
// either using function like `em()` or `rem()`. The Breakpoints plugin has a
// setting that will handle conversion to `em`s for you.
//
// The only execption to this is if you'd like to store `calc()` expressions as
// a variable.
