# Sass Settings

Partials in this folder hold project wide style settings. This is predominantly in the form of variables, however some plugins use mixins. Settings that are more focused should be placed in their more appropriate folders.

Partials in this folder should not output anything to stylesheets. The partials should also be loaded in a specific order, as some settings might rely on other settings. Therefore this folder should not be globbed.
